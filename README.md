#LightingVoid
Part of the *"Fill the Void"* effort. This repository has two purposes. Increase understanding of Bitcoin, and understand lightning network.

- Upon researching Lightning, it became clear that I needed to understand concepts, such as segwit, better.  THerefore, this repository also exists as a playground to better understand various bitcoin concepts.


## Lightning Network: Important Takeaways</h3>
1. Lightning Resources</h3>
