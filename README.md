# LightingVoid
Part of the *"Fill the Void"* effort. This repository has two purposes. Increase understanding of Bitcoin, and understand lightning network.

- Upon researching Lightning, it became clear that I needed to understand concepts, such as segwit, better.  THerefore, this repository also exists as a playground to better understand various bitcoin concepts.


##### This repository was part of my [Fill the Void](./#fill-the-void-repositories) effort to understand Blockchain technology at an expert level.
