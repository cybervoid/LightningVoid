# LightingVoid
This repository has two purposes. Increase understanding of Bitcoin, and understand lightning network.

- Upon researching Lightning, it became clear that I needed to understand concepts, such as segwit, better.  Therefore, this repository also exists as a playground to better understand various bitcoin concepts.  

##### This repository is part of my personal [Fill the Void](https://github.com/cybervoid/fill-the-void) initiative to understand Blockchain technology at an expert level.
